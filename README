RethinkDB Mass Package Builder

   This repo has tools for building RethinkDB on a crapload of
   platforms.  It uses Docker because that's a way to get operating
   system images and run stuff on them.

   Right now, you could run:

       # Mac
       ruby setup.rb

       # Linux
       sudo ruby setup.rb

   Sudo is only necessary if your docker installation needs it.

   In general we will (at some point) want to support kicking off a
   mass package build for a given rethinkdb git commit.  We also want
   to support kicking off an individual package build for a particular
   (rethinkdb git commit, platform) pair.

EXAMPLE USAGE:

    ./setup.rb --help

    # build packages, test installation, and copy packages for jammy
    ./setup.rb -c v2.4.3 --v243support --packages --test-pkgs --copy-pkgs --distro jammy

    # view rethinkdb_2.4.3~0jammy_amd64.deb
    ls artifacts/pkgs

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

   You need Ruby and Docker.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

   - rdbcheckout - clones rethinkdb and fetches the biggest external
     dependencies.  We have this here so we don't have to re-clone and
     fetch for every platform (a zillion times over).

     Keeps the checkout in /rdb

   - bionic, buster, strech, centos8, et al - dockerfiles for building
     on specific platforms

     Copies /rdb from rdbcheckout to /platform, then does its work.

NOTES:

   - The creator of this (Sam Hughes <sam@samuelhughes.com>) is a
     Docker n00b, so feel free to second-guess his decisions.

SEARCH TERMS:

   - "DISAPPEND": A TODO item for a build task that should be moved
     elsewhere.  But currently it isn't, to avoid re-fetching and
     re-building.

     In general, these Dockerfiles are developed in an append-only
     manner, because rebuilding images is really slow.  But if and
     when I have to touch the core file, I'll want to clean up that
     cruft.
